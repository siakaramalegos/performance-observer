We'd love to have you come speak at our meetup! We welcome a mix of new and veteran speakers, so please apply no matter your level.

We also want to encourage more people to speak, especially (but not only) underrepresented folks. So, if you can think of someone who should give a talk, please send them a message and encourage them to fill out the CFP!

Information about speaking at the meetup:

- The meetup is 1 hour long and usually has 2 talks. It's important that you keep your talk length at 20-25 minutes.
- Topics should be about web performance or web-performance-adjacent. We'll curate a variety of talk levels, though narrower scope works better with this crowd and format. Since we don't have enough talk examples yet on this site, check out [performance.now()](https://www.youtube.com/@WebConferencesAmsterdam) and [We Love Speed](https://www.welovespeed.com/en/2024/speakers/) to get an idea of what might work.
- This is a virtual meetup held over Zoom. Make sure that your audio, video, and screen sharing all work correctly before the event. You can request a tech check if you like.
- By default, we record all talks and post them on YouTube. However, you have the ultimate decision on whether it's okay for us to post it. You can decide after the meetup.
- The CFP form is purposely short and informal. If we confirm you as a speaker, then we will give you a separate form for your details to post on the website.
