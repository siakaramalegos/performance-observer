  <h2>About</h2>
  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>PerformanceObserver is a virtual meetup for the web performance community.</p>
  <p>Our community is spread out around the world, and not everyone can easily access in-person tech events. Thus, our mission was to create a meetup that is more accessible to the broader community.</p>
  <h3>How do I register?</h3>
  <p>You don't! We simplified the idea of the meetup since we weren't interested in collecting registration data. Instead, we share the zoom link via the calendar event which is available on this website and in emails from our <a href="#news-signup">newsletter</a>.</p>
  <h3>About the organizers</h3>
