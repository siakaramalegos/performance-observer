# PerformanceObserver

Built with 11ty

TODO

- [ ] check accessibility
- [ ] fix title and description tags - I think this is done, just need to double check
- [ ] check technical seo
- [ ] add social share images
- [ ] Hook up live domain and add webhook to Storyblok

Can be done after the first meetup:

- [ ] add talks page, then individual talk pages (not events like 11ty meetup? - decide on this - could eventually add speaker pages)
- [ ] create social accounts? (and add to footer)
